Mindful Moment is a meditation aid, designed to give you a simple yet appealing interface for you daily moments of mindfulness. Pressing Start on the main page will begin the meditation timer. As the music plays and the day cycles, Mindful Moment keeps track of your time. Pressing Stop will save that time to your Health App, allowing you to keep better track of your moments of your important moments of peace.

##HealthKit
Mindful Moment is a simple meditation app, created as a demonstration of the use of Health Kit for Flatiron Students Presents, a weekly series of development talks by Flatiron School Students. For more information on Health Kit, including info on how to get your app integrated with Apple's Health, the presentation slides are [avaiable here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N7ekvOtYxGC_Mp4iJeDlcQjJEqVnuwZy-NSnfsi5ejs/edit?usp=sharing).
